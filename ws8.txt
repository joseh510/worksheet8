Repeat worksheet #2 using awk to get the entire reviews that are verified or not. 
Use awk to get the entire text of the verified and unverified reviews
Redirect the "verified" true reviews to a file "verified.txt".
Then put the unverified reviews in another file "unverified.txt" using redirection.
Find the 10 most frequent words in the review_body of the verified reviews, then find the 10 most frequent words in the review_body of the unverified reviews. Note: If this is taking too long for the entire dataset, it is sufficient to do it just for 100 reviews so you get an idea.


Used these awk command to get all the verified and unverified amazon reviews and redirected them to new files. 
	awk -F "\t" '($12=="Y")'  amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv  > verified.txt 

	awk -F "\t" '($12=="N")'  amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv  > unverified.txt

Used cut and sed to remove punctuations and common words and HTMLs 

	cut -f 14 verified.txt | sed 's/[,.;]//g' > verified_pt1.txt
	sed 's/and//g;s/or//g;s/if//g;s/in//g;s/it//g;s/br//g' verified_pt1.txt > verified_pt2.txt  
	sed 's|[</>]||g' verified_pt2.txt > verified_pt3.txt

	cut -f 14 unverified.txt | sed 's/[,.;]//g' > unverified_pt1.txt
	sed 's/and//g;s/or//g;s/if//g;s/in//g;s/it//g;s/br//g' unverified_pt1.txt > unverified_pt2.txt
	sed 's|[</>]||g' unverified_pt2.txt > unverified_pt3.txt tr



Used tr to convert all words to lowercase and split each word with a new line character and sorted and counted the unique. 

cat verified_pt3.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -20 > 10_most_freq_words_verified.txt

cat unverified_pt3.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -20 > 10_most_freq_words_unverified.txt

There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to bb[26;1He contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? WW[27;1Hhat are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs tt[28;1Ho change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense oo[29;1Hf one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appearss[30;1H to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicull[31;1Htural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future ress[32;1Hearch and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Businn[33;1Hess Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/vv[34;1Halues system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortaa[35;1Htions of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary  [36;1Hcorporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <bb[37;1Hr /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to taa[38;1Hilor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong A[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H1,1[11CTop[1;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[1;1H[39;167H   [3;1H[39;177H2[3;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[3;1H[39;167H   [6;1H[39;177H3[6;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[6;1H[39;167H   [15;1H[39;177H4[15;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[15;1H[39;167H   [20;1H[39;177H5[20;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[20;1H[39;167H   [1;1H[1;38r[1;1H[23M[1;39r[15;1Hilor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong AA[16;1Hsian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles,  [17;1Hexercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There aree[18;1H many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouragii[19;1Hng the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests  [20;1Hfor job and salary advancement.

I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a WW[24;1Hestern audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under ww[25;1Hhose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it mii[26;1Hght be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and  [27;1Hcalculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter,,[28;1H is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I  [29;1Hcannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Somee[30;1H reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother,,[31;1H the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that CC[32;1Hhamplin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The dd[33;1Hiscussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this precedd[34;1Hing evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his prooo[35;1Hf in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for tt[36;1Hhematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obvioo[37;1Husly to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: tt[38;1Hhus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit.

But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant ww[18;1Heaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidencc[19;1He toward proving them.

It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal:  [23;1HTacitus' Annales XV.67.    Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetitt[24;1Hion of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves  [25;1Has an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with  [26;1HDio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sourr[27;1Hces, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.    Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them.

The use of humans as slaves and the subjugation of women followed the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One thing that sets this book apart ff[32;1Hrom any of the others that describe the problems associated with a meat-based diet is the focus on the spiritual aspects of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingesting thh[33;1He energy contained in this food. Animals that are tortured and filled with terror and agony as they are killed are filled with this very negative energy.  When humans eat their flesh, we are alss[34;1Ho ingesting this fear and anger. This affects us deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our hearts as long as we are filling our bodies with the pain and suffering of other beings. <br />   <br //[35;1H>Tuttle helps us to see that none of us have actually chosen a diet based upon meat. Our mothers fed us meat from our infancy.As we got old enough to understand that we were eating animals, we ww[36;1Here told that animals were put here for us to eat, so it was okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we questioned wearing clothes or taking baths. Thus, we absorbed the acceptance of expll[37;1Hoitation of animals so naturally that we didn't know it was happening.  And being unconscious, it is hard to recognize the violence that is part of our everyday lives through the eating of animaa[38;1Hls.  Therefore, it is also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselves from an awareness of the violence we are part of 3 times a day.   <b[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H[K[39;177H20,1[11C0%[16;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[16;1H[39;167H   [21;1H[39;178H1[21;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[1;38r[1;1H[15M[1;39r[23;1Hls.

He could be considered a living national treasure, and I feel fortunate to be alive as his contemporary.  His body of work is enormous, his influence immm[27;1Heasurable; his importance cannot be overstated. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the copyright date of this book, which is 1971 (despite what the information states, this is probably a third edii[28;1Htion of the book, but I believe all three editions are identical aside from the cover).  The material is relevent and perennial.  Historical Japan has not changed, and Keene's insights are everyy[29;1H bit as valid now as they were when they were set down on paper (most of the material in this book actually predates the 1971 copyright).  The suggested reading list at the back of the book is aa[30;1H superb springboard for further study, should a certain topic particularly amuse the reader, and the listed volumes are also excellent and continue to be highly relevent. <br /> <br />While a nee[31;1Hw edition is well-purchased at $22, an older edition can be had cheaply.  I personally own the second edition and am quite pleased with it.  I actually find myself here looking for a hardbound vv[32;1Hersion, but, as one does not exist, I must make do with asserting my heartfelt opinion for this volume. <br /> <br />Basically amounting to an Anthology of Keene of sorts, a collection of some oo[33;1Hf his writings on Japan, it's an invaluable text.  Were I to teach a general class in Japanese culture, this would surely be a book to include; perhaps it would be the only book necessary.  Infii[34;1Hnitely readable, inspirational, interesting, and difficult to put down, I couldn't recommend it more highly.   <br /> <br />If my contributions to the study of Japan and the bridging of culturess[35;1H amount to even a percentage of Keene's, my life will have been quite a productive one. <br /> <br />Another option to pursue is another collection of Keene's writings called, \\"The Blue-Eyed TT[36;1Haroukaja,\\" and its copyright is much more recent.  It's also highly recommended alongside this one.     2005-10-14

In typical fashion, the administration responded only when the UCS report gained media attenn[35;1Htion, and then only to dismiss it as a partisan attack from the left. <br /> <br />Chris Mooney's book documents in plain and incontrovertible fashion why the UCS report was not only non-partisaa[36;1Hn truth, but significantly understated the case. The current political abuse of science is only the culmination of a consistent strategy fostered by a \\"hard right\\" alliance of corporate and  [37;1Hreligious conservatives that has gained control of the Republican party since the 1960's. <br /> <br />Corporate attacks on science started with tobacco industry efforts to undermine studies on  [38;1Hthe health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry has been consistently followed since: the terms \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", mea[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H[K[39;177H23,1[11C0%[17;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[17;1H[39;167H   [29;1H[39;178H4[29;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[29;1H[39;167H   [1;1H[1;38r[1;1H[31M[1;39r[7;1Hthe health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry has been consistently followed since: the terms \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", meaa[8;1Hningless in any scientific sense, originated with tobacco lawsuits and have been parlayed by conservatives into codewords for science that respectively supports or threatens \\"conservative\\" ii[9;1Hdeology. <br /> <br />Mooney categorizes the attacks on science as falling into two main categories. The first of these is an undermining of the processes of science by suppression of informatioo[10;1Hn, targeting individual scientists (many of whom work for the government or rely on government grants), or rigging review and advisory committees. The second form these right-wing attacks take ii[11;1Hs through the communication process to the public after reports are released. This includes \\"spinning\\" the science through misrepresentations or distortions, magnifying uncertainty, relying  [12;1Hon and promoting fringe scientists and \\"contrarians\\", and putting scientific clothing on \\"values\\" and ideology. <br /> <br />\\"Manufacturing uncertainty\\" was a key to the tobacco induu[13;1Hstry strategy that has been repeated again and again on issues from global warming to evolution.  Finding a token scientist to magnify \\"contrarian\\" claims isn't hard: science's health comes  [14;1Hfrom the weathering of constant attacks by those who choose to think differently. But sadly there are also too many scientists willing to distort their own research to conform to the ideologies  [15;1Hof funding sources, and a disturbing number of government scientists working for regulatory agencies have been encouraged to alter conclusions of their reports. Mooney notes the sharp distinctioo[16;1Hn in conclusions on the effects of second-hand smoke between industry-funded and independent scientists. <br /> <br />It is one thing to argue and make political decisions based on all the best  [17;1Hfacts available. That's what we expect our leaders to do. But the right wing attack on science is not satisifed with the facts as they are on the environemnt, biology or medicine. Rather they see[18;1Hek to distort those facts, imposing ideology at an earlier stage, so that decision makers and the public don't even have the truth available to them to make good decisions. <br /> <br />Many of  [19;1Hthe \\"contrarian\\" scientists who have been selected by the Bush administration to sit on major oversight and advisory panels have very little research background at all. Unfortunately, sciencc[20;1He's ivory tower makes it far too easy to \\"play scientist\\" for the public - there are no external credentialing mechanisms that effectively separate real experts from impostors. Tellingly, foo[21;1Hr these political hacks the arguments change with time as the facts on the ground become increasingly inconvenient to their ideology. Denial of global warming becomes denial of human causation,  [22;1Hnow morphing into assertion that global warming will be good for us. Creationism becomes \\"intelligent design\\". <br /> <br />The broad range of regulatory and scientific areas where the same  [23;1Hanti-science tactics have been used forces the conclusion that this is more than separate isolated incidents. Similar issues with failed intelligence on 9-11 and Iraq's WMD, and other apparent ee[24;1Hfforts to conceal the facts on the ground by the administration imply this pattern of ideological decision making extends far beyond  the areas where science is the central source of facts. <br  [25;1H/> <br />There are examples of liberal science abuse too, where individuals are tempted to spin the facts to fit their ideology. Mooney cites a few cases, but the only systematic pattern seems tt[26;1Ho be one of exaggeration of direct effects and perhaps denial of uncertainty. Of the examples in question, almost all show liberal statements to be much closer to the scientific facts than the rr[27;1Hight-wing spin on the same issues. Even so, neither side should try to twist science to their benefit, and to his credit Mooney does criticize both. <br /> <br />The book has a few flaws: there  [28;1Hare occasional jarring repetitions of previous arguments that suggest chapters were rewritten several times in mid-stream, without reconsidering the book as a whole. Mooney also seems reluctant  [29;1Hto state as baldly as possible what's going on here: some people are lying about the facts, and as a result, other people are dying needlessly. Isn't there legal recourse for such fraud, as happp[30;1Hened in the case of tobacco? <br /> <br />Mooney makes a number of sensible suggestions beyond legal action: reinstate the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, pass legislation to bar  [31;1Hpolitical litmus tests for committees, roll back the \\"sound science\\" regulatory reform that has done so much harm. More skepticism and understanding of the processes of science from journalii[32;1Hsts would be a big help, as would some reforms in the science community itself.  But as he also points out, significant change will be impossible in our democracy as long as the current ideologuu[33;1Hes hold all the strings of power. Getting the information out somehow and persuading the public to vote for moderates instead of ideologues is the most important thing we can do - will it be enoo[34;1Hugh?  2005-10-14

This is actually too soon for this review to be written -- I've only been pursuing the stretches (exercises) for a little over a month now.<br /><br />  On  [25;1Hthe plus side, I believe I can credit this book with helping me get through the last week or so -- in addition to a cold, I ended up dealing with back, leg, and shoulder problems after a day of  [26;1Htree cutting and trimming, another day of construction work on the house, and a third day of helping our grown children prepare their pool for winter storage, which included letting cold water rr[27;1Hun over my feet for two hours.  I've suffered from short hamstrings for most of my life, a condition that was finally diagnosed just last year, and any one of those days (besides the cold) wouldd[28;1H have previously put me in bed for at least a day.  The combination should have put me in hospital for at least four days.  Not to say that I didn't have problems, but thanks in part to techniquu[29;1Hes and stretches from Mr. Cooley's book, I managed to stay active and motile, and have now almost fully recovered.<br /><br />  To the negative, it could be that Mr. Cooley puts too much stock ii[30;1Hn his own discoveries, and he is certainly too used to working with people with already-developed athletic capabilities.<br /><br />  First, \\"too much stock in his own discoveries.\\"  The firr[31;1Hst section of the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience, and how he came upon his stretching techniques while recovering for that experience.  I have not yet walked his  [32;1Hpath long enough to deliver a real judgement, but I suspect that part of the benefits he ascribes to his techniques is actually a normal part of his return trip from death's door.<br /><br />  TT[33;1Hhis is not to say that there is no value in his stretching techniques, but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everything\\" he represents them to be.<br /><br />  The second negativv[34;1He is that I find his presentation better suited to those who are already developed athletically rather than the majority of us who are somewhat motion impared.  By his own statement, Mr. Cooley  [35;1Hdiscovered his first stretching techniques while attempting a middling-advanced yoga position. His book also includes testimonies from several world-class athletes, which I certainly would not dd[36;1Hispute.  However, I had to invent several \\"remedial\\" stretches before even attempting the beginning series of stretches presented in his book (fortunately I have some theraputic streching ann[37;1Hd hatha yoga in my background), and a few of the illustrations for the beginning stretches seem misleading if not plain wrong.  The intermediate and advanced series appear to be correct, as far  [38;1Has I can currently tell.<br /><br />  Mr. Cooley's basic premise is that first, streching is good and second, stretching against resistance is better.

Theroretically this makes sense, since thee[17;1Hn all the cells in a muscle would elongate rather than just those involved at the muscle's maximum extension.  Also, \\"resistence stretching\\" is very similar to what most of us do naturally jj[18;1Hust before or after arising from bed.  However, as noted in the book, the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decline if only his stretching techniques are used.  Again this makes sense ---[19;1H from my observation, the existing strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion for that muscle, and as the muscle cells and fibers elongate, the \\"new\\" portion oo[20;1Hf them is weak until strengthened through other forms of exercise.  In fairness, the book points out that the stretches can be turned into strength building exercises by reversing their directioo[21;1Hn, but the follow-through on this concept is weak.<br /><br />  I don't feel qualified to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles and the \\"meridians\\" of traditii[22;1Honal Chinese medicine is valid.  I do know that, while many of his positions approximate those of hatha yoga, the muscle groups involved don't necessarily correspond -- for example, the \\"childd[23;1H\\" position in both yoga and western rehabilitation therapy focuses on the lower back and Mr. Cooley uses it to stretch the upper back, shoulders and arms.  Not necessarily wrong, mind you, butt[24;1H a much different emphasis.  Also, the beginning series doesn't quite involve ALL of the muscle groups, at least as I understand them.<br /><br />  In summary:  The book's main feature is \\"ress[25;1Histance stretching\\" (which might also be described as isometrics in motion).  While not the universal panacea it's presented to be, the concept IS quite useful and beneficial. It should be usee[26;1Hd in addition to other exercise techniques, not as a replacement for them, and Mr. Cooley would do well to include a set of remedial \\"absolute beginner\\" stretches for the less athletic amongg[27;1H us.  Meanwhile, I'm glad I got the book, and I intend to keep doing the stretches. 2005-10-14

In setting forth his apology and objectives, Whedbee recognizes the danger of explaining the prophets systematically based upon a narrow selection of texts. For some time, scc[11;1Hholars drove a deep wedge between the 'prophet's word' and the 'sage's counsel'.<br /><br />A number of changes in the prevailing scholarly winds have made a study like Whedbee's possible. The ss[12;1Hage is now viewed more positively as a guardian of communal integrity than was the case in a previous generation. Also the complex-rather than simple-relationship between traditional wisdom and  [13;1Hthe prophetic task has become more evident. Whedbee proposes to sort out traditional versus technical wisdom as it appears in Isaiah, presuming that the latter emerges out of the former. Also, hh[14;1He anticipates showing his reader how Isaiah processes and adapts wisdom traditions as he inherits and employs them.<br /><br />Having sketched out a refreshingly loose-fitting-not to say baggy-pp[15;1Hrofile for wisdom and its origins, forms, and intentionalities, Whedbee approaches the formal matter of 'Parables, Proverbs, and Related Gattungen' in an extensive chapter two (pp. 23-79). Methoo[16;1Hdologically, he cautions against assuming the presence of wisdom influence on Isaiah wherever there is overlap with wisdom terminology. Rather, he seeks distinctive (parabolic) content for the bb[17;1Hasis of his study. Whedbee is attentive to the 'heterogonous' nature of Isaiah's argumentation, a perspective that allows him to evade the analytical trap of absolutizing genres and then dissectt[18;1Hing speeches in order to assign each element to a distinct classification. Isaiah, Whedbee says, is 'free' to use a large number of figures of speech, some of which take a sapiential tack, becauu[19;1Hse the disjunction between prophetic word and creation's witness is a modern rather than an ancient one. For the prophet, the two would have enjoyed an essential unity.<br /><br />In his third cc[20;1Hhapter ('Woe Oracles and Wisdom', pp. 80-110), Whedbee argues for a close relationship between the Hebrew Bible's 'woe' oracles and the 'ashrey' ('blessed is ...') statements. He approves Gerstee[21;1Hnberger's discernment of a strong concern for social justice in both kinds of affirmations, provisionally accepting as well Gerstenberger's theory that the statements derive from popular wisdom  [22;1Hsettings. After surveying some of the distinctly Isaianic 'woes', Whedbee concludes that both law and wisdom emerge from a common source and thus it is not wise to distinguish too sharply betweee[23;1Hn their respective influence as traditionary sources for Isaiah. Nevertheless, it would be equally unwise to overlook the instructional/sapiential nature of Isaiah's utilization of the traditionn[24;1H.<br /><br />In 'Counsel/Counsellor and Jerusalem Court Wisdom' (ch. four, pp. 111-148), Whedbee argues for a non-secular (in the technical sense) view of professional wisdom circles in biblicall[25;1H Israel and Judah. That is, these circles had their own view of the divine source of counsel and wisdom and their own tradition regarding the inherent limitations of human wisdom. Isaiah's critii[26;1Hcism of the sages of his day used their own language ('etsah) and was not uniquely prophetic. Though he criticizes the counsellors of his day, his vision for the future includes wise counsellorss[27;1H, indeed a messianic figure that is cast in part in the figure of just such a counsellor. In contrast to the policies supported by the court counsellors of his day-some of which Isaiah found inii[28;1Hmical to Yahwistic faith-the prophet rests in the divine 'counsel' which is not only inscrutable but also trustworthy in its intentions for Israel/Judah.<br /><br />A conclusion (pp. 149-153) nee[29;1Hatly restates the outline of an argument that is both cogent and well-presented in the core ofthe book. In the thirty-four years since its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in  [30;1Hgeneral has stood its ground admirably.

However, I counted at least three errors in the book.  Early in the  [31;1Hbook President Theodore Roosevelt is listed as being from the Harvard Class of 1880.  Several pages later he's listed as the class of 1895.  (1880 is the correct date...)  In discussions of Frann[32;1Hk Hinkey, he is mentioned as one of only 5 four-time All Americans.  In the photo section, his picture is accompanied by a description that says he is one of 11 four-time All Americans.  Then, tt[33;1Hhere is discussion of Ivy League football dropping from Division I-A to I-AA.  At first this is mentioned as having happened in 1982.  Later in the book, the 1974 Yale team is noted to have the  [34;1Hbest defense in Division I-AA.  (But they were still in Division I-A in '74, weren't they?)  <br /> <br />Anyway, these were three glaring errors that I picked up without doing any research or ff[35;1Hact-checking.  It just makes me wonder how many other errors are in the book that I didn't notice?  2005-10-14

I was captivated by \\"White Teeth\\"'s sometime caricaturr[29;1He-ish portrayal of the culturally and ethnically diverse cast of characters:  some of them take themselves too seriously, some of them don't think much of themselves or of their surroundings, buu[30;1Ht in the author made even the most self-conscious characters be a little self-deprecating in a humorous way.  Details are thrown at the reader either purposefully and effectively, or in a way thh[31;1Hat adds more color to the writing.  Upon reading the book, I felt that it's alright to take one's self seriously, and it's alright if one doesn't, but that we should both respect and take some hh[32;1Humor in our diversity.  In \\"White Teeth\\" I felt that the author used diversity as a very good tool to make captivate the reader's interest, propel the story along, introduce conflict, and inn[33;1Htroduce humor all at the same time. <br /> <br />In \\"On Beauty\\", there is still that sprinkling of ethnic and cultural details, strong and minute, but they are more often neither necessary nn[34;1Hor effective.  It seems that taking all the ethnic, gender, and cultural aspects from this novel will not subtract much from it.  The wit is still there, the cartoonish portrayals of certain arcc[35;1Hhetypes and stereotypes are still there, but they are disconnected from the storyline.  I have not read the original inspiration of this story, so perhaps I am missing something here, but if I hh[36;1Hadn't read \\"White Teeth\\" I will still have written the same about \\"On Beauty\\". <br /> <br />If you have read \\"White Teeth\\" and really enjoyed it, then \\"On Beauty\\" is worth the prr[37;1Hice of admission.  If you have not read \\"White Teeth\\" and know Zadie Smith only from book reviews and interviews, I will only hesitatingly recommend this book.  Perhaps it is Smith's familiaa[38;1Hrity with the British way of life that makes \\"White Teeth\\" appear to be a moreintegral and effortless piece of writing, but both aspects are lacking in this latest novel.    2005-10-13[39;177H[K[39;177H60,1[11C0%[21;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[21;1H[39;167H   [23;1H[39;178H1[23;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[1;38r[1;1H[10M[1;39r[29;1HUS      50350474[8CR1KZCGXXYR5I9N  0226096262      265045610[7CSynthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games      Books   5[7C3[7C7[7CN[7CY[7CA Virtual  [30;1HGem   Dr. Ted Castronova is a remarkable man with startlingly clear vision and profound insight into an increasingly important aspect of modern society, the blending of the real world with synthh[31;1Hetic worlds.

Cannot wait (even though I have to) for the next book. I will not go into the story because when other reviewers do this it sometimes ruins the book for me if they give too much away. JJ[37;1Hust trust me you will love it.  2005-10-13

The exercisee[3;1Hs outlined in this book, which I learned in conjunction with physical therapists associated with the New York University medical center, have been immensely helpful in preventing on-going pain aa[4;1Hnd any severe reoccurrence.   <br /> <br />Of course, you should do these exercises only with the consultation of a doctor and/or physical therapist, especially if you have acute back pain causee[5;1Hd by a protruding or ruptured disc. Also, of course, you should combine them (eventually) with a program to strengthen and stretch your muscles.  But, as many of you know, with back pain it can  [6;1Hbe very difficult to do these other exercises until you have found fundamental relief to the underlying causes of the pain, and these exercises, properly applied and for the right cases, can accc[7;1Homplish this. <br /> <br />The limited amount of time they take (litereally a couple of minutes) make these exercises very easy to maintain over time. <br /> <br />Robin McKenzie has been acknoww[8;1Hledged around the world for his work with back pain.  His credentials are strong.  If you have found many other books to be generic and not that helpful, this one is different.

I was captivated by \\"White Teeth\\"'s sometime caricaturr[3;1He-ish portrayal of the culturally and ethnically diverse cast of characters:  some of them take themselves too seriously, some of them don't think much of themselves or of their surroundings, buu[4;1Ht in the author made even the most self-conscious characters be a little self-deprecating in a humorous way.  Details are thrown at the reader either purposefully and effectively, or in a way thh[5;1Hat adds more color to the writing.  Upon reading the book, I felt that it's alright to take one's self seriously, and it's alright if one doesn't, but that we should both respect and take some hh[6;1Humor in our diversity.  In \\"White Teeth\\" I felt that the author used diversity as a very good tool to make captivate the reader's interest, propel the story along, introduce conflict, and inn[7;1Htroduce humor all at the same time. <br /> <br />In \\"On Beauty\\", there is still that sprinkling of ethnic and cultural details, strong and minute, but they are more often neither necessary nn[8;1Hor effective.  It seems that taking all the ethnic, gender, and cultural aspects from this novel will not subtract much from it.  The wit is still there, the cartoonish portrayals of certain arcc[9;1Hhetypes and stereotypes are still there, but they are disconnected from the storyline.  I have not read the original inspiration of this story, so perhaps I am missing something here, but if I hh[10;1Hadn't read \\"White Teeth\\" I will still have written the same about \\"On Beauty\\". <br /> <br />If you have read \\"White Teeth\\" and really enjoyed it, then \\"On Beauty\\" is worth the prr[11;1Hice of admission.  If you have not read \\"White Teeth\\" and know Zadie Smith only from book reviews and interviews, I will only hesitatingly recommend this book.  Perhaps it is Smith's familiaa[12;1Hrity with the British way of life that makes \\"White Teeth\\" appear to be a moreintegral and effortless piece of writing, but both aspects are lacking in this latest novel.    2005-10-13[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H[K[39;177H64,1[11C0%[17;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[17;1H[39;167H   [13;1H[39;178H3[13;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[13;1H[39;167H   [7;1H[1;38r[1;1H[6L[1;39r[1;1HUS      52691483[8CR373ZLOMEN9Z68  1586087096      168611627[7CThe Trigon Rituals      Books   3[7C8[7C17      N[7CY[7CGood sex little plot    Overall better than averagg[2;1He for the genre, but with limited humor and no reeal plot I can't give it a higher rating inspite of thw well written errotic scenes. 2005-10-14

I didn't  [3;1Hknow what a pitot tube is, and I appreciate the fact that Rod Machado doesn't assume that the reader knows that or even that they know how to pronounce it. He says, \\"that' pee-toe, not pilot\\\[4;1H" which is helpful. If you've hung around airports for the past ten years, you probably already knew how to pronounce it, but I didn't. This excellent attention to detail is this books strength..[5;1H The author gives not one, but two photographs of pitot tube and explains that they are usually found under the left wing. As another example, I had read elsewhere that you need to test your fuee[6;1Hl for water, but a single glance at the two photographs he included turned the concept from some vague ethereal haze in the back of my mind to a simple, \\"Okay. I get it.\\" You can see this hee[7;1Hre on Amazon by clicking the \\"Look inside this book\\" link under the photograph of the book, then go forward a couple of pages to page A3. Figure 7 at the bottom of the page has the caption:  [8;1H\\"Under the wing is a fuel tank sump drain. Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities, the sumps should be drained before every flight and after every fueling.\\" Figure  [9;1H8 next to it shows someone checking for impurities witha clear plastic fuel strainer. Nothing beats seeing it. <br /> <br />What I don't like about this book (and the reason I only gave it four  [10;1Hstars) are the dumb jokes. When I read about the silly humor in another review I thought, \\"Lighten up, how bad can it really be?\\" Bad. Worse than you think. In fact, I think it detracts fromm[11;1H an otherwise excellent book. What exactly does the author mean in the example above when he says, \\"Since airplane engines don't seem to run very well on impurities...\\"? Apparently, it's a jj[12;1Hoke (yuk, yuk). Besides from being distracting, it seems like what we get is a joke instead of information: what kind of impurities are we talking about here? Water? Or something else? These jokk[13;1Hes are peppered throughout the text and they very quickly become tedious. I wish they were in the margin or in a different font so that I could ignore them. On page A5 the author talks about strr[14;1Hobe lights on planes. One sentence starts, \\"This is necessary because...\\" I thought to myself, this must be an important point I'd better remember it. Disappointingly, the sentence ends withh[15;1H \\"...because screaming out the window does not work.\\" If these silly jokes were in a special font I could have more easily skipped over them and they would have been less irritating. <br />  [16;1H<br />This is a large (as big as a medium size phone book), thorough and very well illustrated book and I'm glad I bought it.     2005-10-14[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H[K[39;177H40,1[11C0%[17;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[1;38r[1;1H[15L[1;39r[1;1HUS      37314706[8CRQYTSKYK7YP74   1932564667      416312175[7CShadowrun, Fourth Edition[7CBooks   4[7C16      20      N[7CY[7CRenewing the Shadows    Shadowrun has alwaa[2;1Hys been about change, adaptation, and growing from the issues of the past. With each new edition that has arrived since the game's conception back in 1989, a new set of rules, more stream lined,,[3;1H more focused on fun rather than rule mongering, has arisen. Shadowrun 4th edition is the biggest rule change yet.<br /><br />Vet's to the game who enjoyed the game for it's rule's, not it's gamm[4;1Hing world, have voiced their distaste for the game. I myself was very skeptical of these completely new rules. Let me clarify now, this game has indeed evolved, and these new rules are a step inn[5;1H the right direction. Players of games like Vampire: the Masquarde/the Requiem, Werewolf: the Apocalypse/the Forsaken, and other World of Darkness 1.0 and 2.0 games wil find these rules a bit faa[6;1Hmiliar and comforting.<br /><br />Dice tests are no long single skills with the hopeful adding of a combat or specialty dice pool. Instead, tests are made combining attributes and skills into a  [7;1Hcombined pool, and all tests aim for the same Target Number \\"Hit\\" of 5. Modifiers just add or take away dice now, and the rule of one has been completly reworked.<br /><br />Thus, all vets tt[8;1Ho the game line will have to learn a whole new set of rules if htey want to stay alive in the shadows, but that's something they should be used to, adaptation.<br /><br />New Gamers will find thh[9;1Hese new rule sets much easier to approach than the older sets. While it feels like character creation is more complicated (which is something shadowrun has been known for), gameplay is smoother,,[10;1H the game suffers less from the same old \\"specialty classes getting so much alone time while they do their thing and everyone else gets a big break\\".

In five well-balanced chapp[2;1Hters, the author opens up the important question about the extent to which the prophet Isaiah-and thus the book that bears his name-was influenced by the strain of Israelite reflection that schoo[3;1Hlars call 'wisdom'. In setting forth his apology and objectives, Whedbee recognizes the danger of explaining the prophets systematically based upon a narrow selection of texts. For some time, scc[4;1Hholars drove a deep wedge between the 'prophet's word' and the 'sage's counsel'.<br /><br />A number of changes in the prevailing scholarly winds have made a study like Whedbee's possible. The ss[5;1Hage is now viewed more positively as a guardian of communal integrity than was the case in a previous generation. Also the complex-rather than simple-relationship between traditional wisdom and  [6;1Hthe prophetic task has become more evident. Whedbee proposes to sort out traditional versus technical wisdom as it appears in Isaiah, presuming that the latter emerges out of the former. Also, hh[7;1He anticipates showing his reader how Isaiah processes and adapts wisdom traditions as he inherits and employs them.<br /><br />Having sketched out a refreshingly loose-fitting-not to say baggy-pp[8;1Hrofile for wisdom and its origins, forms, and intentionalities, Whedbee approaches the formal matter of 'Parables, Proverbs, and Related Gattungen' in an extensive chapter two (pp. 23-79). Methoo[9;1Hdologically, he cautions against assuming the presence of wisdom influence on Isaiah wherever there is overlap with wisdom terminology. Rather, he seeks distinctive (parabolic) content for the bb[10;1Hasis of his study. Whedbee is attentive to the 'heterogonous' nature of Isaiah's argumentation, a perspective that allows him to evade the analytical trap of absolutizing genres and then dissectt[11;1Hing speeches in order to assign each element to a distinct classification. Isaiah, Whedbee says, is 'free' to use a large number of figures of speech, some of which take a sapiential tack, becauu[12;1Hse the disjunction between prophetic word and creation's witness is a modern rather than an ancient one. For the prophet, the two would have enjoyed an essential unity.<br /><br />In his third cc[13;1Hhapter ('Woe Oracles and Wisdom', pp. 80-110), Whedbee argues for a close relationship between the Hebrew Bible's 'woe' oracles and the 'ashrey' ('blessed is ...') statements. He approves Gerstee[14;1Hnberger's discernment of a strong concern for social justice in both kinds of affirmations, provisionally accepting as well Gerstenberger's theory that the statements derive from popular wisdom  [15;1Hsettings. After surveying some of the distinctly Isaianic 'woes', Whedbee concludes that both law and wisdom emerge from a common source and thus it is not wise to distinguish too sharply betweee[16;1Hn their respective influence as traditionary sources for Isaiah. Nevertheless, it would be equally unwise to overlook the instructional/sapiential nature of Isaiah's utilization of the traditionn[17;1H.<br /><br />In 'Counsel/Counsellor and Jerusalem Court Wisdom' (ch. four, pp. 111-148), Whedbee argues for a non-secular (in the technical sense) view of professional wisdom circles in biblicall[18;1H Israel and Judah. That is, these circles had their own view of the divine source of counsel and wisdom and their own tradition regarding the inherent limitations of human wisdom. Isaiah's critii[19;1Hcism of the sages of his day used their own language ('etsah) and was not uniquely prophetic. Though he criticizes the counsellors of his day, his vision for the future includes wise counsellorss[20;1H, indeed a messianic figure that is cast in part in the figure of just such a counsellor. In contrast to the policies supported by the court counsellors of his day-some of which Isaiah found inii[21;1Hmical to Yahwistic faith-the prophet rests in the divine 'counsel' which is not only inscrutable but also trustworthy in its intentions for Israel/Judah.<br /><br />A conclusion (pp. 149-153) nee[22;1Hatly restates the outline of an argument that is both cogent and well-presented in the core ofthe book. In the thirty-four years since its publication, Whedbee's work has been criticized but in  [23;1Hgeneral has stood its ground admirably.

This is actually too soon for this review to be written -- I've only been pursuing the stretches (exercises) for a little over a month now.<br /><br />  On  [9;1Hthe plus side, I believe I can credit this book with helping me get through the last week or so -- in addition to a cold, I ended up dealing with back, leg, and shoulder problems after a day of  [10;1Htree cutting and trimming, another day of construction work on the house, and a third day of helping our grown children prepare their pool for winter storage, which included letting cold water rr[11;1Hun over my feet for two hours.  I've suffered from short hamstrings for most of my life, a condition that was finally diagnosed just last year, and any one of those days (besides the cold) wouldd[12;1H have previously put me in bed for at least a day.  The combination should have put me in hospital for at least four days.  Not to say that I didn't have problems, but thanks in part to techniquu[13;1Hes and stretches from Mr. Cooley's book, I managed to stay active and motile, and have now almost fully recovered.<br /><br />  To the negative, it could be that Mr. Cooley puts too much stock ii[14;1Hn his own discoveries, and he is certainly too used to working with people with already-developed athletic capabilities.<br /><br />  First, \\"too much stock in his own discoveries.\\"  The firr[15;1Hst section of the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience, and how he came upon his stretching techniques while recovering for that experience.  I have not yet walked his  [16;1Hpath long enough to deliver a real judgement, but I suspect that part of the benefits he ascribes to his techniques is actually a normal part of his return trip from death's door.<br /><br />  TT[17;1Hhis is not to say that there is no value in his stretching techniques, but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everything\\" he represents them to be.<br /><br />  The second negativv[18;1He is that I find his presentation better suited to those who are already developed athletically rather than the majority of us who are somewhat motion impared.  By his own statement, Mr. Cooley  [19;1Hdiscovered his first stretching techniques while attempting a middling-advanced yoga position. His book also includes testimonies from several world-class athletes, which I certainly would not dd[20;1Hispute.  However, I had to invent several \\"remedial\\" stretches before even attempting the beginning series of stretches presented in his book (fortunately I have some theraputic streching ann[21;1Hd hatha yoga in my background), and a few of the illustrations for the beginning stretches seem misleading if not plain wrong.  The intermediate and advanced series appear to be correct, as far  [22;1Has I can currently tell.<br /><br />  Mr. Cooley's basic premise is that first, streching is good and second, stretching against resistance is better.  Theroretically this makes sense, since thee[23;1Hn all the cells in a muscle would elongate rather than just those involved at the muscle's maximum extension.  Also, \\"resistence stretching\\" is very similar to what most of us do naturally jj[24;1Hust before or after arising from bed.  However, as noted in the book, the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decline if only his stretching techniques are used.  Again this makes sense ---[25;1H from my observation, the existing strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion for that muscle, and as the muscle cells and fibers elongate, the \\"new\\" portion oo[26;1Hf them is weak until strengthened through other forms of exercise.  In fairness, the book points out that the stretches can be turned into strength building exercises by reversing their directioo[27;1Hn, but the follow-through on this concept is weak.<br /><br />  I don't feel qualified to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles and the \\"meridians\\" of traditii[28;1Honal Chinese medicine is valid.  I do know that, while many of his positions approximate those of hatha yoga, the muscle groups involved don't necessarily correspond -- for example, the \\"childd[29;1H\\" position in both yoga and western rehabilitation therapy focuses on the lower back and Mr. Cooley uses it to stretch the upper back, shoulders and arms.  Not necessarily wrong, mind you, butt[30;1H a much different emphasis.  Also, the beginning series doesn't quite involve ALL of the muscle groups, at least as I understand them.<br /><br />  In summary:  The book's main feature is \\"ress[31;1Histance stretching\\" (which might also be described as isometrics in motion).  While not the universal panacea it's presented to be, the concept IS quite useful and beneficial. It should be usee[32;1Hd in addition to other exercise techniques, not as a replacement for them, and Mr. Cooley would do well to include a set of remedial \\"absolute beginner\\" stretches for the less athletic amongg[33;1H us.  Meanwhile, I'm glad I got the book, and I intend to keep doing the stretches. 2005-10-14[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H[K[39;177H32,1[11C0%[7;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[1;38r[1;1H[5L[1;39r[1;1HUS      49718706[8CR2SJUYZ120GAWE  091242320X      635275320[7CBeyond Chaos: One Man's Journey Alongside His Chronically Ill Wife      Books   5[7C14      15      N[7CY[7CHoo[2;1Hnestly written![7CThis is one of the best books on how people cope with Fibro that I have read.

In typical fashion, the administration responded only when the UCS report gained media attenn[4;1Htion, and then only to dismiss it as a partisan attack from the left. <br /> <br />Chris Mooney's book documents in plain and incontrovertible fashion why the UCS report was not only non-partisaa[5;1Hn truth, but significantly understated the case. The current political abuse of science is only the culmination of a consistent strategy fostered by a \\"hard right\\" alliance of corporate and  [6;1Hreligious conservatives that has gained control of the Republican party since the 1960's. <br /> <br />Corporate attacks on science started with tobacco industry efforts to undermine studies on  [7;1Hthe health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry has been consistently followed since: the terms \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", meaa[8;1Hningless in any scientific sense, originated with tobacco lawsuits and have been parlayed by conservatives into codewords for science that respectively supports or threatens \\"conservative\\" ii[9;1Hdeology. <br /> <br />Mooney categorizes the attacks on science as falling into two main categories. The first of these is an undermining of the processes of science by suppression of informatioo[10;1Hn, targeting individual scientists (many of whom work for the government or rely on government grants), or rigging review and advisory committees. The second form these right-wing attacks take ii[11;1Hs through the communication process to the public after reports are released. This includes \\"spinning\\" the science through misrepresentations or distortions, magnifying uncertainty, relying  [12;1Hon and promoting fringe scientists and \\"contrarians\\", and putting scientific clothing on \\"values\\" and ideology. <br /> <br />\\"Manufacturing uncertainty\\" was a key to the tobacco induu[13;1Hstry strategy that has been repeated again and again on issues from global warming to evolution.  Finding a token scientist to magnify \\"contrarian\\" claims isn't hard: science's health comes  [14;1Hfrom the weathering of constant attacks by those who choose to think differently. But sadly there are also too many scientists willing to distort their own research to conform to the ideologies  [15;1Hof funding sources, and a disturbing number of government scientists working for regulatory agencies have been encouraged to alter conclusions of their reports. Mooney notes the sharp distinctioo[16;1Hn in conclusions on the effects of second-hand smoke between industry-funded and independent scientists. <br /> <br />It is one thing to argue and make political decisions based on all the best  [17;1Hfacts available. That's what we expect our leaders to do. But the right wing attack on science is not satisifed with the facts as they are on the environemnt, biology or medicine. Rather they see[18;1Hek to distort those facts, imposing ideology at an earlier stage, so that decision makers and the public don't even have the truth available to them to make good decisions. <br /> <br />Many of  [19;1Hthe \\"contrarian\\" scientists who have been selected by the Bush administration to sit on major oversight and advisory panels have very little research background at all. Unfortunately, sciencc[20;1He's ivory tower makes it far too easy to \\"play scientist\\" for the public - there are no external credentialing mechanisms that effectively separate real experts from impostors. Tellingly, foo[21;1Hr these political hacks the arguments change with time as the facts on the ground become increasingly inconvenient to their ideology. Denial of global warming becomes denial of human causation,  [22;1Hnow morphing into assertion that global warming will be good for us. Creationism becomes \\"intelligent design\\". <br /> <br />The broad range of regulatory and scientific areas where the same  [23;1Hanti-science tactics have been used forces the conclusion that this is more than separate isolated incidents. Similar issues with failed intelligence on 9-11 and Iraq's WMD, and other apparent ee[24;1Hfforts to conceal the facts on the ground by the administration imply this pattern of ideological decision making extends far beyond  the areas where science is the central source of facts. <br  [25;1H/> <br />There are examples of liberal science abuse too, where individuals are tempted to spin the facts to fit their ideology. Mooney cites a few cases, but the only systematic pattern seems tt[26;1Ho be one of exaggeration of direct effects and perhaps denial of uncertainty. Of the examples in question, almost all show liberal statements to be much closer to the scientific facts than the rr[27;1Hight-wing spin on the same issues. Even so, neither side should try to twist science to their benefit, and to his credit Mooney does criticize both. <br /> <br />The book has a few flaws: there  [28;1Hare occasional jarring repetitions of previous arguments that suggest chapters were rewritten several times in mid-stream, without reconsidering the book as a whole. Mooney also seems reluctant  [29;1Hto state as baldly as possible what's going on here: some people are lying about the facts, and as a result, other people are dying needlessly. Isn't there legal recourse for such fraud, as happp[30;1Hened in the case of tobacco? <br /> <br />Mooney makes a number of sensible suggestions beyond legal action: reinstate the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, pass legislation to bar  [31;1Hpolitical litmus tests for committees, roll back the \\"sound science\\" regulatory reform that has done so much harm. More skepticism and understanding of the processes of science from journalii[32;1Hsts would be a big help, as would some reforms in the science community itself.  But as he also points out, significant change will be impossible in our democracy as long as the current ideologuu[33;1Hes hold all the strings of power.

His body of work is enormous, his influence immm[3;1Heasurable; his importance cannot be overstated. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by the copyright date of this book, which is 1971 (despite what the information states, this is probably a third edii[4;1Htion of the book, but I believe all three editions are identical aside from the cover).  The material is relevent and perennial.  Historical Japan has not changed, and Keene's insights are everyy[5;1H bit as valid now as they were when they were set down on paper (most of the material in this book actually predates the 1971 copyright).  The suggested reading list at the back of the book is aa[6;1H superb springboard for further study, should a certain topic particularly amuse the reader, and the listed volumes are also excellent and continue to be highly relevent. <br /> <br />While a nee[7;1Hw edition is well-purchased at $22, an older edition can be had cheaply.  I personally own the second edition and am quite pleased with it.  I actually find myself here looking for a hardbound vv[8;1Hersion, but, as one does not exist, I must make do with asserting my heartfelt opinion for this volume. <br /> <br />Basically amounting to an Anthology of Keene of sorts, a collection of some oo[9;1Hf his writings on Japan, it's an invaluable text.  Were I to teach a general class in Japanese culture, this would surely be a book to include; perhaps it would be the only book necessary.  Infii[10;1Hnitely readable, inspirational, interesting, and difficult to put down, I couldn't recommend it more highly.   <br /> <br />If my contributions to the study of Japan and the bridging of culturess[11;1H amount to even a percentage of Keene's, my life will have been quite a productive one. <br /> <br />Another option to pursue is another collection of Keene's writings called, \\"The Blue-Eyed TT[12;1Haroukaja,\\" and its copyright is much more recent.  It's also highly recommended alongside this one.     2005-10-14

This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to grow spiritually, who wants to live a conscious and compassionate life, and who wann[3;1Hts to contribute to world peace. I have read many books on the topic of vegetarianism, animal rights and animal welfare,  spiritual growth, and peace and nonviolence. This book stands alone in ii[4;1Hts ability to make the connection between all of these subjects. <br /> <br />Will Tuttle, Ph.D. is a rare combination of extraordinary compassion, scholarly research and education, spiritual coo[5;1Hmmitment and wisdom, intuitive insights, and the courage to challenge a worldview which goes back 10,000 years <br />  <br />In this book, Tuttle explores humanity's relationship with the foods  [6;1Hwe eat.  He points out, very convincingly, that when humans began herding animals, it began to create a consciousness of exploitation which then spread to the control and domination of other humm[7;1Hans, as well as animals.  So the roots of human's violence to humans are found in the practice of seeing animals as objects to exploit for our own purposes: for food, furs, labor, entertainment,,[8;1H \\"sport\\" and experimentation. The use of humans as slaves and the subjugation of women followed the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One thing that sets this book apart ff[9;1Hrom any of the others that describe the problems associated with a meat-based diet is the focus on the spiritual aspects of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingesting thh[10;1He energy contained in this food. Animals that are tortured and filled with terror and agony as they are killed are filled with this very negative energy.  When humans eat their flesh, we are alss[11;1Ho ingesting this fear and anger. This affects us deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our hearts as long as we are filling our bodies with the pain and suffering of other beings. <br />   <br //[12;1H>Tuttle helps us to see that none of us have actually chosen a diet based upon meat. Our mothers fed us meat from our infancy.As we got old enough to understand that we were eating animals, we ww[13;1Here told that animals were put here for us to eat, so it was okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we questioned wearing clothes or taking baths. Thus, we absorbed the acceptance of expll[14;1Hoitation of animals so naturally that we didn't know it was happening.  And being unconscious, it is hard to recognize the violence that is part of our everyday lives through the eating of animaa[15;1Hls.  Therefore, it is also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselves from an awareness of the violence we are part of 3 times a day.   <bb[16;1Hr />  <br />This is a very important book for everyone who wants their lives to contribute to more peace in the world, rather than more suffering and violence.  <br />  <br />   2005-10-14[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H[K[39;177H23,1[11C0%[17;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[39;167H~@k[17;1H[39;167H   [9;1H[1;38r[1;1H[8L[1;39r[1;1HUS      16416628[8CR1HVJ4Q7J3S1QO  0875796001      191642496[7CReexploring the Book of Mormon  Books   5[7C6[7C6[7CN[7CY[7CMany essays of worth    This book relseaedd[2;1H by FARMS in the early 1990's is one of the books I would suggest to anyone, LDS or no-LDS, to better understand the text from a variety of perspectives.<br /><br />First of all, the exegetical,,[3;1H with such essays focusing on the meaning and background to pericope within the Book of Mormon text, such as the Nephite Sacramental prayers in Moroni 4-5 and their historical development withinn[4;1H Nephite culture, as seen in Mosiah 1-6 and 3 Nephi 18.<br /><br />Moreover, there is the scholary and apologetic, with the discussion of the disscovery of the place \\"Nahom\\" in 1 Nephi 16:344[5;1H, and many other issues, some which refute critical claims against the Book of Mormon volume.   2005-10-14

As a physician and early American history buff I was really looking forward to learning more about Benjamin  [3;1HRush.<br /><br />In general it seems that the author, despite putting out what appears to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source materials to find out who Benjamin Ruu[4;1Hsh was and why he was important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush's fame and accomplishments and influence, but the details are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a great doctor Rush was, considered tt[5;1Hhe preeminent physician of his times, according to the author, but all the author writes about is how Rush tortured his patients with medical treatments we now know are harmful, such as bloodlett[6;1Hting, giving cathartics, etc.  Rush is known as the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", his book on psychiatry was bible for many many years, and his observations on mental illness were in manyy[7;1H ways way way ahead of his times...yet not a word of this is mentioned except in the last ten pages of this 365 page book.  This subject desperately needed to explained.  This is why he is imporr[8;1Htant for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinating to have gotten a better feel for what bloodletting and giving cathartics was about, we needed some good oldd[9;1H source material, firsthand observations and then-current thoughts, as well as an expose of the tools employed, etc.  Rush, it is clear, considered himself first and foremost and physician.  He  [10;1Hdedicated his life to the practice of medicine, he was considered a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physicians for the next half century were either disciples of Rush orr[11;1H disciples of his students.....but we don't really get a feeling for why.<br /><br />His political contributions and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibrr[12;1He of Hamilton or Jefferson, he was definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seemed to focus on explaining the political events occurring around Rush during the fii[13;1Hght for independence.  The focus should have been Rush.  There's a lot of negativity surrounding Rush early on in the book, but how he seems to know all the important figures in the Revolution aa[14;1Hnd why they respect him is not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any pictures or illustrations.

For example, the human mind is excellent at recognizing patterns in things...to succ[3;1Hh a degree that we find many patterns in things which are actually random.  Another bias is the basic tendency to be accepting of evidence which is consistent with our belief but subjecting contt[4;1Hradictory evidence to more careful scrutiny.  I have heard the explanation that chronic gamblers tend to relive their wins and block out their losses.  In actual fact, they dwell on the losses aa[5;1H lot more than the wins.  If so, why do they continue not only to gamble, but believe that they are better at it than they really are?  The answer is that their wins are almost always viewed as  [6;1Hdue to talent and many of the losses are re-categorized as \\"near wins.\\" (\\"If not for that field goal in the last seconds of the game, I would have won\\"--much more so than the correspondii[7;1Hng \\"I almost lost that one, but they kicked a field goal at the end of the game and saved it for me.\\")  The first 125 pages cover six different types of bias (and variations of them). <br />>[8;1H <br />The last third of the book analyzes three cases (alternative medicine, social interaction strategies, & ESP) where there is a lot of belief which is not supported by evidence.

Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter,,[7;1H is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I  [8;1Hcannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Somee[9;1H reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen.

The dd[12;1Hiscussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this precedd[13;1Hing evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to bb[3;1He contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? WW[4;1Hhat are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs tt[5;1Ho change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense oo[6;1Hf one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appearss[7;1H to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicull[8;1Htural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future ress[9;1Hearch and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Businn[10;1Hess Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/vv[11;1Halues system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortaa[12;1Htions of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary  [13;1Hcorporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <bb[14;1Hr /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to taa[15;1Hilor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong AA[16;1Hsian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles,  [17;1Hexercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There aree[18;1H many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouragii[19;1Hng the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests  [20;1Hfor job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Maa[21;1Hr (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />[7C2005-10-14[38;1H[1m[34m@@@                                                                                                                                                                                               [0m[39;177H[K[39;177H6,1[12C0%[1;1H[34h[?25h[?25l[1;38r[1;1H[9L[1;39r[1;1HUS      25947084[8CRC48H2YC6599S   0060513926      266734975[7CRebels of Babylon: A Novel (Abel Jones Mysteries)[7CBooks   5[7C2[7C2[7CN[7CY[7CAnother victory foo[2;1Hr Owen Parry!

It is a wonderful story that not only entertains, but also enlightens about one of the most important eras in our history, and, one oo[4;1Hf the most important cities and cultures (New Orleans) in our country.

thanks  part to techniques  stretches from Mr Cooley's book I managed to stay active  motile  have now almost fully recovered    To the negative  could be that Mr Cooley  [6;1Hputs too much stock  his own discoveries  he is certaly too used to wkg wh people wh already-developed athletic capabilies    First \\"too much stock  his own discoveries\\"  The first section oo[7;1Hf the book describes how Bob Cooley survived a near-death experience  how he came upon his stretchg techniques while recoverg f that experience  I have not yet walked his path long enough to dell[8;1Hiver a real judgement but I suspect that part of the benefs he ascribes to his techniques is actually a nmal part of his return trip from death's do    This is not to say that there is no value  [9;1H his stretchg techniques but rather that they may not be the \\"univeral fix-everythg\\" he represents them to be    The second negative is that I fd his presentation better sued to those who arr[10;1He already developed athletically rather than the majy of us who are somewhat motion impared  By his own statement Mr Cooley discovered his first stretchg techniques while attemptg a middlg-advann[11;1Hced yoga posion His book also cludes testimonies from several wld-class athletes which I certaly would not dispute  However I had to vent several \\"remedial\\" stretches befe even attemptg the  [12;1Hbegng series of stretches presented  his book (ftunately I have some theraputic strechg  hatha yoga  my background)  a few of the illustrations f the begng stretches seem misleadg  not pla wrongg[13;1H  The termediate  advanced series appear to be crect as far as I can currently tell    Mr Cooley's basic premise is that first strechg is good  second stretchg agast resistance is better  Therett[14;1Hically this makes sense sce then all the cells  a muscle would elongate rather than just those volved at the muscle's maximum extension  Also \\"resistence stretchg\\" is very similar to what moo[15;1Hst of us do naturally just befe  after arisg from bed  However as noted  the book the \\"immediate strength\\" of a muscle will decle  only his stretchg techniques are used  Aga this makes sensee[16;1H -- from my observation the existg strength of a muscle becomes \\"spread\\" over the entire range of motion f that muscle  as the muscle cells  fibers elongate the \\"new\\" ption of them is wee[17;1Hak until strengthened through other fms of exercise  In fairness the book pots out that the stretches can be turned to strength buildg exercises by reversg their direction but the follow-throughh[18;1H on this concept is weak    I don't feel qualied to comment on whether his claimed connection between his exercise cycles  the \\"meridians\\" of tradional Chese medice is valid  I do know that  [19;1Hwhile many of his posions approximate those of hatha yoga the muscle groups volved don't necessarily crespond -- f example the \\"child\\" posion  both yoga  western rehabilation therapy focusess[20;1H on the lower back  Mr Cooley uses  to stretch the upper back shoulders  arms  Not necessarily wrong md you but a much dferent emphasis  Also the begng series doesn't que volve ALL of the musclee[21;1H groups at least as I underst them    In summary:  The book's ma feature is \\"resistance stretchg\\" (which might also be described as isometrics  motion)  While not the universal panacea 's prr[22;1Hesented to be the concept IS que useful  beneficial It should be used  addion to other exercise techniques not as a replacement f them

DO NOT BE FOOLED AS I WAS! I dered this study guide  preparation f the ASE tests that I was gog to be takg this fall  This guide is very poly put together  NOT EVEN PROOFREAD apparently's a compp[21;1Hlete joke!  Let me give you a few examples of why this is a HUGE waste of your money    First of all as you may  may not already know the ASE test questions are copyrighted  therefe CANNOT be ree[22;1Hproduced  This means that the \\"sample questions\\"  this guide are not ACTUAL ASE questions but rather questions that the auth of the book made up that are designed to be similar  style to thee[23;1H ones you would see on a real ASE exam  ALL study guides are this way which is fe so long as the person makg up the questions is somewhat competentthe person who wrote this book IS NOT COMPETENTT[24;1H  Many of the questions are que misleadg  some of the answers are just pla wrong! EVEN accdg to the fmation that THEY THEMSELVES give  the study guide!    There are so many typo's  mistakes  thii[25;1Hs book I got the feelg I was readg a book rept wrten by my 3rd grade sister      Each sample question is SUPPOSEDLY lked (by way of a reference number wh a crespondg section) back to the sectionn[26;1H that explas how to do the procedure from which the question was based  THERE WERE SEVERAL SAMPLE QUESTIONS THAT LINKED BACK TO A SECTION IN THE BOOK THAT DIDN'T EVEN EXIST!!!!! I mean how frustt[27;1Hratg is that!    And then there is this hoopla that they sell you on about havg \\"explanations f each sample question tellg why the crect answer is right as well as why the wrong answers are wrr[28;1Hong\\"  WHAT A QUACK!  A typical example of one of the sample questions  their \\"detailed explanation\\" f  would go somethg like this:    Question:  Technician A says [blah blah blah] Technicii[29;1Han B says [yada yada yada] Who is crect?    a Technician A  b Technician B c Both Technicians A  B are crect  d Neher Technician A  B is crect    Explanation:  a The crect answer is a \\"technicc[30;1Hian A is crect\\"  b Answer B is not crect: [restates what technician B said WORD FOR WORD here] is not crect [WHAT THE CRAP KIND OF EXPLANATION IS THAT???????!!!!!!]  c Answer C is not crect bee[31;1Hcause technician B is crect  d Answer D is not crect because technician A is crect    WOULD THIS NOT FRUSTRATE YOU TOO WITH YOUR TESTS FAST APPROACHING?    Anyway the first ASE study guide that  [32;1HI bought was a MITCHELL1 series study guideafter becomg very frustrated at the qualy of the study guide I decided to purchase a dferent  so I went wh the DELMAR series study guide  MUCH TO MY DII[33;1HSMAY when  arrived I found that  was THE EXACT SAME BOOK as the MITCHELL1!!!!  BUYERS BEWARE!!! Apparently DELMAR learng bought out MITCHELL as well as CHILTON repair books companies  now has soo[34;1Hme st of monopoly on the whole market  It's sickeng reallynot because of the monopoly so much but because DELMAR puts out such hrible products      Anyway I just thought I would give you all thee[35;1H heads up so you do not make the same mistake I didwhen I bought the book there were no reviews on  so after my experience I thought SOMEBODY needs to expose this JUNK f what  is  I would put thh[36;1He company out of busess  I could  DO everyone a favspread the wd around that DELMAR does NOT sell good products!

recent thkg  physics    the wld of spir  meang He bases himself on &quotmonistic   idealism&quot which he claims is &quotthe crect philosophy f science    viee[9;1Hw of quantum physics&quot[p54] The idea of monistic idealism is   roughly that the prime realy is outside space-time  generates   all tempal  &quotlocal&quot phenomena But this is about as closee[10;1H as   Goswami ever comes to deliverg on the promise of his subtle   &quotHow Consciousness Creates the Material Wld&quot So  this is what   terests you be warned that this book is not a wk on coo[11;1Hsmology[7CThe crux of the argument is that nonlocal distance-dependent   stantaneous effects have their source  a transcendent doma   outside of space-time Goswami begs by illustratg the   rr[12;1Helationship between consciousness  quantum measurement    claims that  is observation  awareness that collapses a   &quotquantum wave&quot to a local observable phenomenon[7CThe implication  [13;1His that collapse ( thus observation) creates the   restricted tempal wld Limed awareness  subjectivy   derive from time-lags memy  &quottangled hierarchies&quot I quote:   &quotAccdg to monisticc[14;1H idealism objects
